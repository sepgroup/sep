/**
 * Core classes that provide JavaFX support for JFreeChart.
 */
package org.jfree.chart.fx;

// SEP GROUP COMMENT:
// For some reason these classes weren't included in the core JFreeChart package in maven central.
// So they needed to be copied into the project to use JFreeChart with JavaFX.
